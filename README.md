# Introduction

<br>
</br>
This project showcases a Terrain Generation system capable of producing procedurally generated terrains. These terrains are enhanced with texture mapping that dynamically adjusts based on the terrain's height, resulting in realistic representations of various landscape features, such as grasslands and sandy areas. Additionally, the project includes a procedurally generated animated water feature for added realism.
