## Introduction


This project showcases a Terrain Generation system capable of producing procedurally generated terrains. These terrains are enhanced with texture mapping that dynamically adjusts based on the terrain's height, resulting in realistic representations of various landscape features, such as grasslands and sandy areas. Additionally, the project includes a procedurally generated animated water feature for added realism.

### Software Information

* Includes Animated / Procedurally generated Water.
* Procedurally generated Terrain with Multiple uses of Textures depending on height!
* 3D movabale camera use AWSD (Move around) and Arrow Keys (To look around).
* May take some time to load at first, but let it go about it! :)
