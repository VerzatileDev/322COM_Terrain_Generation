## Terrain Generation 322COM Task 2

In this project you will find a Terrain Generation, that displays a procudurally
generated terrain with image textures attacked to it. Meaning that on height level
it will showcase grass texture sand or other depending on the area defined.

-This Project is not Fully Complete and Requires some futher work, thoguh it is difficult
to understand the details on how to make some of the things happen as it can be confusing to
understand the mixed signals of the module. Where Presentations tell 1 information, github tells you
Good luck here is what you need to do. Now go back a previous module that is small amounts related
and hope for the best that you cna figure out how to integrate those functions to a new version of
opengl and different way of doing it.
